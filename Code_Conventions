Code and working process conventions for CL-eshop project.

Firstly look at standard naming/coding conventions for Common Lisp:
http://www.cliki.net/naming%20conventions
http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/cmsc421/norvig-lisp-style.pdf

Project specific conventions:
- Each function name shoud start with name of containing file. Example: function in xls.lisp file should look like (defun xls.foo () ...)

- Each keyword in loop macro should start with colon. Example:
(loop
   :for x
   :in (list 1 2 3)
   :do (foo x))
but not
(loop
   for x
   in (list 1 2 3)
   do (foo x))

- When you describe new anonimous function it should follow #'(lambda () ...) (not (lambda () ...)) convention.

- When you need to validate some data, use (if data ...) not (if (not (null data)) ...)

- Add documentation lines, if purpose of function/variable is not obvious
